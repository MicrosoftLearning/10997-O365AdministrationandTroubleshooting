- Configure tenant options.

>  **Note:** The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Office 365. Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual. Your instructor will provide you with the lab documentation.

### Lab setup
  
 Estimated time: 45 minutes

Virtual machines:  **MT17B-WS2016-NAT**,  **10997A-LON-DC1**, and  **10997A-LON-CL1**

 User name:  **Adatum\\Administrator**

 Password:  **Pa55w.rd**

 For this lab, you need to use the available virtual machine environment. Before you begin the lab, if necessary, you must complete the following steps:

1. On the host computer, click  **Start**, point to  **Administrative Tools**, and then click  **Hyper-V Manager**.

2. In Hyper-V Manager, click  **MT17B-WS2016-NAT**, and then, in the  **Actions** pane, click **Start**.

3. In the  **Actions** pane, click **Connect**. Wait until the virtual machine starts.

4. In Hyper-V Manager, click  **10997A-LON-DC1**, and then, in the  **Actions** pane, click **Start**.

5. In the  **Actions** pane, click **Connect**. Wait until the virtual machine starts.

6. Sign in by using the following credentials:

  - User name:  **Administrator**

  - Password:  **Pa55w.rd**

  - Domain:  **Adatum**

7. Repeat steps 4 and 5 on  **10997A-LON-CL1**, and then sign in by using the following credentials:

  - User name:  **Holly**

  - Password:  **Pa55w.rd**

  - Domain:  **Adatum**


 In all tasks:

- Where you see references to  **Adatum*yyxxxx*.onmicrosoft.com**, replace  **Adatum_yyxxxx_** with your unique Office 365 name that you choose in Lab 1 - Exercise 1, Task 1.



## Exercise 1: Setting up an Office 365 lab environment
  
### Scenario
  
 The first step in starting the pilot deployment is to configure the Office 365 tenant. You need to create a new tenant using the  **Adatum*yyxxxxx*.onmicrosoft.com** domain name.

>  **Note:** This lab uses a standard Office 365 trial account, not a FastTrack pilot extended tenant account. Also, you need to create an account with a unique name in the form: **Adatum*yyxxxxx*.onmicrosoft.com**. You can use your two primary initials followed by a unique four-digit number. For example, Adatum **_AB1234_**.


 The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Create an Office 365 Enterprise E5 trial subscription and enable directory synchronization

2. Verify the health of services



#### Task 1: Create an Office 365 Enterprise E5 trial subscription and enable directory synchronization
  
1. On  **LON-CL1**, open Microsoft Edge, and then go to the following URL:  [**https://aka.ms/v2jy2f**](https://aka.ms/v2jy2f). 

2. Click  **Free trial**.

3. For Step 1, in the  **Welcome, let's get to know you** page, complete the following fields. Regardless of your location, use the following information:

  - Country:  **United Kingdom**

  - First name:  **Holly**

  - Last name: ** Spencer**

  - Business email address:  *Use your new Microsoft account that you created for this course or your personal email address*.

  - Business phone number:  *Use your mobile phone number, including the international code, for the country/region that you are really in*.

  - Company name:  **A. Datum**

  - Organization size:  **50-249 people**

4. For Step 2, create a unique domain for the company name to use in the course. Use the  **_Adatumyyxxxxx_** form. For the rest of the fields, use the following information:

  - User name:  **Holly**

  - Company name: **Adatum_yyxxxxx_** (where **_yyxxxxx_** is your unique Adatum number)

  - Password:  Create a password that meets the complexity requirements. Document Holly's password.

  - Confirm password:  Type the same password

5. For Step 3, confirm your identity by using your mobile phone. Under  **Send text message**, from the drop-down box, select the code for the country/region that you are really in.

6. In the  **Phone number** box, enter your correct mobile phone number.

7. Ensure that the  **Send text message** option is selected, and then click **Text me**.

8. When you receive the confirmation text on your mobile phone, enter the code provided into the  **Enter your verification code** box.

9. Click  **Create my account**.

10. Wait until the Office 365 tenant is provisioned, and then click  **You're ready to go**.

11. Click the  **Admin** tile to go to the Office 365 admin center.



#### Task 2: Verify the health of services
  
1. Use  **Service health** on the navigation menu on the left to display the **Service health** dashboard.

2. Review any service interruption records and additional information on the  **Incidents** page.

>  **Note:** During Microsoft testing, on rare occasions Office 365 did not create the trial tenant properly. As a result, the tenant did not have all the services available to it. If this happens to you, create a new trial tenant by using a different business email address (a Microsoft account).

3. Close Microsoft Edge.

4. If you receive a prompt, click  **Close all tabs**.


>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have successfully provisioned the Office 365 tenant account for A. Datum Corporation.
